High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.1 Application and purpose,Link to fit and proper standard,"In substance, the Principles express the main dimensions of the ""fit and proper"" standard set for firms in threshold condition 5 (Suitability), although they do not derive their authority from that standard or exhaust its implications. Being ready, willing and organised to abide by the Principles is therefore a critical factor in applications for Part 4A permission, and breaching the Principles may call into question whether a firm with Part 4A permission is still fit and proper."
High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.1 Application and purpose,Link to fit and proper standard,"For persons authorised or registered under the Payment Services Regulations or the Electronic Money Regulations, the relevant “fit and proper standards” are the standards set in those Regulations."

Compliance by another person to whom the Principles apply with Principles 3, 4 and 11 can also be affected by the activities of other persons who are members of their group.14 This does not mean that, for example, inadequacy of a group member's risk management systems or resources will automatically lead to a firm contravening Principle 3 or 4. Rather, the potential impact of a group member's activities (and, for example, risk management systems operating on a group basis) will be relevant in determining the adequacy of the firm's risk management systems or resources respectively."
High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.1 Application and purpose,Standards in markets outside the United Kingdom,"As set out in PRIN 3.3 (Where?), Principles 1 (Integrity), 2 (Skill, care and diligence) and 3 (Management and control) apply to world-wide activities in a prudential context. Principle 5 (Market conduct) applies to world-wide activities which might have a negative effect on confidence in the UK financial system. In considering whether to take regulatory action under these Principles in relation to activities carried on outside the United Kingdom, the FCA11 will take into account the standards expected in the market in which the firm or other person to whom the Principles apply14 is operating. Principle 11 (Relations with regulators) applies to world-wide activities; in considering whether to take regulatory action under Principle 11 in relation to cooperation with an overseas regulator, the FCA11 will have regard to the extent of, and limits to, the duties owed by the firm or other person14 to that regulator. (Principle 4 (Financial prudence) also applies to world-wide activities.)"

High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.1 Application and purpose,Consequences of breaching the Principles,"Breaching a Principle makes a firm or other person to whom the Principles apply liable to disciplinary sanctions. In determining whether a Principle has been breached it is necessary to look to the standard of conduct required by the Principle in question. Under each of the Principles the onus will be on the FCA11 to show that a firm or other person14 has been at fault in some way. What constitutes ""fault"" varies between different Principles. Under Principle 1 (Integrity), for example, the FCA11 would need to demonstrate a lack of integrity in the conduct of a firm's or other person’s14 business. Under Principle 2 (Skill, care and diligence) a firm or other person14 would be in breach if it was shown to have failed to act with due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of its business. Similarly, under Principle 3 (Management and control) a firm or other person14 would not be in breach simply because it failed to control or prevent unforeseeable risks; but a breach would occur if the firm or other person14 had failed to take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly or effectively."
High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.1 Application and purpose,Consequences of breaching the Principles,"The Principles are also relevant to the FCA's powers of information-gathering, to vary a firm's Part 4A permission or authorisation or registration under the Payment Services Regulations or Electronic Money Regulations14, and of investigation and intervention, and provide a basis on which the FCA15 may apply to a court for an injunction or restitution order or require a firm or other person14 to make restitution. However, the Principles do not give rise to actions for damages by a private person (see PRIN 3.4.4 R)."
High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.1 Application and purpose,Consequences of breaching the Principles,"Some of the other rules and guidance in the Handbook deal with the bearing of the Principles upon particular circumstances. However, since the Principles are also designed as a general statement of regulatory requirements applicable in new or unforeseen situations, and in situations in which there is no need for guidance, the FCA's other rules and guidance or EU regulations11 should not be viewed as exhausting the implications of the Principles themselves."

These requirements depend, in part, on the characteristics of the client or customer concerned. This is because what is ""due regard"" (in Principles 6 and 7), ""fairly"" (in Principles 6 and 8), ""clear, fair and not misleading"" (in Principle 7), ""reasonable care"" (in Principle 9) or ""adequate"" (in Principle 10) will, of course, depend on those characteristics. For example, the information needs of a general insurance broker will be different from those of a retail general insurance policyholder."
High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.2 Clients and the Principles,Approach to client categorisation3,"Principles 6, 8 and 9 and parts of Principle 7, as qualified by PRIN 3.4.1 R, apply only in relation to customers. The approach that a firm (other than for credit-related regulated activities, and regulated claims management activities10payment services and issuing electronic money (where not a regulated activity)11 in relation to which client categorisation does not apply)5 needs to take regarding categorisation3of clients into customers and eligible counterparties4 will depend on whether the firm is carrying on designated investment business, insurance risk transformation and activities directly arising from insurance risk transformation,9 or other activities, as described in PRIN 1.2.3 G."
High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.2 Clients and the Principles,Approach to client categorisation3,"In relation to the carrying on of designated investment business, insurance risk transformation and activities directly arising from insurance risk transformation9, a firm's categorisation of a client under the COBS client categorisation chapter (COBS 3) will be applicable for the purposes of Principles 6, 7, 8 and 9.3
In relation to the carrying on of insurance risk transformation and activities directly arising from insurance risk transformation, the COBS client categorisation chapter (COBS 3) applies as modified by COBS 18.6A.3R.9
Client categorisation under COBS 3 or PRIN 1 Annex 1 is not relevant to credit-related regulated activities and therefore the guidance on client categorisation does not apply in relation to a credit-related regulated activity. The definitions of client and customer in relation to those regulated activities reflect the modified meaning of “consumer” in articles 36J, 39M, 60LA, 60S7 and 89E of the Regulated Activities Order, as well as the definitions of  “individual” and of “relevant recipient of credit” in that Order.5
Client categorisation under COBS 3 or PRIN 1 Annex 1R is not relevant to regulated claims management activities and therefore the guidance on client categorisation does not apply in relation to a regulated claims management activity. 10
The person to whom a firm gives basic advice on a stakeholder product will be a retail client for all purposes, including the purposes of Principles 6, 7, 8 and 9.43
In relation to carrying on activities other than  designated investment business, insurance risk transformation or activities directly arising from insurance risk transformation9 (for example, general insurance business or accepting deposits) the firm may choose to comply with Principles 6, 7, 8 and 9 as if all its clients were customers. Alternatively, it may choose to distinguish between eligible counterparties and customers in complying with those Principles. If it chooses to make such a distinction, it must comply with PRIN 1 Annex 1 in determining whether that client is an eligible counterparty (see PRIN 3.4.2 R). In doing so, the requirements in SYSC will apply, including the requirement to make and retain adequate records.3
In relation to carrying on activities that fall within both (1) and (3) (for example, mixed designated investment business and accepting deposits), a firm's categorisation of a client under the COBSclient categorisation chapter (COBS 3) will be applicable for the purposes of Principles 6, 7, 8 and 9.3"
High Level Standards,PRIN Principles for Businesses,PRIN 1 Introduction,PRIN 1.2 Clients and the Principles,Approach to client categorisation3,"If the person with or for whom the firm is carrying on an activity is acting through an agent, the ability of the firm to treat the agent as its client under COBS 2.4.3 R (Agent as client) will not be available. For example, if a general insurer is effecting a general insurance contract through a general insurance broker who is acting as agent for a disclosed policyholder, the policyholder will be a client of the firm and the firm must comply with the Principles accordingly."

High Level Standards,GEN General Provisions,GEN 2 Interpreting the Handbook,GEN 2.2 Interpreting the Handbook,Rules and guidance applying while a firm has temporary permission – capital adequacy requirements,"GEN 2.2.30R operates by excluding the application of the sourcebooks contained in the Prudential Standards part of the FCA Handbook, except for the sourcebooks or parts of sourcebooks referred to in GEN 2.2.30R(2). The sourcebooks referred to in GEN 2.2.30R(2) contain rules that may apply to a TP firm either by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R(1) if they applied to that firm immediately before IP completion day, or rules that may apply to a TP firm by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R(2) if the conditions in that provision are met, and the rule does not relate to capital adequacy. The approach in GEN 2.2.30R to applying rules relating to capital adequacy to a TP firm is generally to ensure that the firm is only subject to those rules that applied to it immediately before IP completion day25. Therefore, a TP firm will not be subject to additional capital adequacy requirements to those that applied to the firm immediately before IP completion day25. The sourcebooks referred to in GEN 2.2.30R(2) contain some rules which do not relate to capital adequacy. Such rules may apply to TP firms by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R. Certain of these rules may apply to TP firms by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R(2), as follows: rules in MIPRU 2.2 (Allocation of the responsibility for insurance distribution activity or MCD credit intermediation activity); certain of the rules in MIPRU 3.2 (Professional indemnity insurance requirements); rules in MIPRU 5.2 (Use of intermediaries); and certain of the rules in IPRU(INV) 13.1 (Application, general requirements and professional indemnity insurance requirements). The sourcebooks contained in the Prudential Standards part of the FCA Handbook are not the only sourcebooks which include rules relating to capital adequacy. For example, see the rules in CONC 10 and MAR 8. The capital adequacy requirements in such other sourcebooks may apply to a TP firm by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R, to the extent the firm carries on the relevant regulated activity. However, a TP firm will not be subject to additional capital adequacy requirements to those that applied to the firm immediately before IP completion day25. For the purpose of this guidance, rules relating to capital adequacy comprise rules relating to the adequacy of a firm’s financial resources, including both capital resources and liquidity resources. However, rules relating to capital adequacy do not include rules involving the holding of professional indemnity insurance, except where such rules are tied to capital adequacy requirements by a form of optionality (for examples of such rules, see IPRU(INV) 9.2.4R and IPRU(INV) 13.1A.3R). Therefore, rules involving the holding of professional indemnity insurance may apply to a TP firm by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R, but if such rules are tied to capital adequacy requirements, they cannot apply by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R(2)."

If as a result of: the UK’s withdrawal from the EU; and complying with a rule applied by GEN 2.2.32R, a TP UCITS qualifier or a TP AIFM qualifier would contravene a provision in its Home State, the rule applied by GEN 2.2.32R which caused the contravention, to the extent necessary, does not apply."

High Level Standards,GEN General Provisions,GEN 2 Interpreting the Handbook,GEN 2.2 Interpreting the Handbook,Purpose,"The approach to what rules apply to TP firms is broadly to apply rules to TP firms which applied to them immediately prior to IP completion day26, whether those rules applied in the United Kingdom (as was the case for host state rules) or, where rules are directive-based, in the firm’s Home State or, where relevant under an EU measure in relation to which the law of the country of origin applies, the state where the establishment is located and from which the firm’s service is provided. The Glossary definitions of TP firm and temporary permission each include both firms that enter the temporary permission or temporary variation regime set out in Part 3 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations and firms that enter the financial services contracts regime set out in Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations on or after IP completion day25. GEN 2.2.26R (1) and GEN 2.2.33R refer to “a rule which imposed an obligation on a person”. This is to distinguish a rule which imposes substantive obligations from a rule which sets out the application of rules. GEN 2.2.26R to GEN 2.2.35R apply rules and guidance to firms which before IP completion day25 had passporting rights by virtue of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or of that Treaty as applied by the Agreement on the European Economic Area signed at Oporto on 2 May 1992 whose parties consist of the EEA States. The application of rules and guidance to TP firms under Part 3 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations must be read in the light of the purpose of temporary permission under Part 3 of those Regulations, which is to allow TP firms to continue to carry on regulated activities in the United Kingdom, or of the purpose of the temporary recognition regime for TP UCITS qualifiers or for TP AIFM qualifiers to continue to market funds in the United Kingdom. In each case that purpose takes into account that the legal framework underpinning cross border financial services has changed because the Treaty, EU regulations and EU directives no longer apply in the United Kingdom by virtue of EU law. For a TP firm under Part 3 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations the scope of authorisation of an EEA-based firm which qualified for authorisation under Schedule 3 or 4 to the Act is preserved. Those Regulations do not extend the means by which a TP firm can carry on regulated activities in the United Kingdom, which remain limited (leaving aside top-up permission) to those which were available under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, for example, a firm carrying on regulated activities in the United Kingdom from an establishment outside of the EEA cannot rely upon this means to do so. For a TP firm under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations, the scope of the firm’s permission is further limited by what is permitted under regulation 33 or 40 of those Regulations. The General Rules also apply where regulated activities have been amended on IP completion day25, because the purpose of temporary permission is to enable TP firms to continue to carry on such regulated activities in the United Kingdom. Part 6 of the Collective Investment Schemes (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 enables a new sub-fund to be a recognised scheme for the purposes of Part 17 of the Act in certain circumstances. Therefore, the purpose of GEN 2.2.32R(2) is to ensure that a rule applies to a TP UCITS qualifier in relation to a new sub-fund if that rule would have applied to the sub-fund had it been a scheme recognised under section 264 of the Act immediately before IP completion day25 (unless the contrary intention appears). In relation to persons with temporary EMI authorisation, temporary PI authorisation and temporary RAISP authorisation, the specified directions, rules and guidance in FEES 4A, 7C and 13A apply to them. In addition, in relation to those persons, rules and guidance in DISP, SUP, PRIN and BCOBS apply to them as they apply to electronic money institutions, payment institutions and registered account information service providers24 that are authorised or registered in the UK. A person with temporary EMI authorisation is deemed to be an authorised electronic money institution in accordance with regulation 2(a) of Part 1 of Schedule 3 of the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations. As such, the provisions of the Electronic Money Regulations as amended by the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations and subject to the exclusions set out in regulation 7 of the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations apply to such persons. This paragraph applies to persons with temporary PI authorisation and temporary RAISP authorisation: a person with temporary PI authorisation is deemed to be an authorised payment institution in accordance with regulation 14(2)(a)(i) of Part 2 of Schedule 3 of the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations. a person with temporary RAISP authorisation is deemed to be a Registered Account Information Service Provider in accordance with regulation 2(2)(a)(ii) of Part 2 of Schedule 3 of the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations. As such, the provisions of the Payment Services Regulations as amended by the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations and subject to the exclusions set out in regulation 19 of the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations apply to persons to whom paragraph (11) applies. The Glossary definitions of temporary EMI authorisation, temporary PI authorisation and temporary RAISP authorisation each include both persons that enter the temporary permission regime set out in Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3 of the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations and persons that enter the financial services contracts regime in accordance with regulation 12B and 26 of Parts 1A and 3 of Schedule 3 of the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations."
High Level Standards,GEN General Provisions,GEN 2 Interpreting the Handbook,GEN 2.2 Interpreting the Handbook,The effect of the General Rules,"The approach in these rules is a general one and does not apply where a rule states explicitly that a different provision applies to such a firm or that position is stated in relation to the rule. The FCA has decided in certain cases specifically to apply rules to TP firms, for example: in relation to the application of our Principles for Businesses (PRIN); in chapters 4A, 6, 7C, 7D and 13A, and at rule 5.1.1CR, of the Fees Manual (FEES); in the General Provisions (GEN) which relate to status disclosure; in the Client Assets sourcebook (CASS) at chapter 14; in the Compensation sourcebook (COMP); in chapters 1, 2 and 3 of the Dispute Resolution: Complaints sourcebook (DISP); in relation to the approved persons regime, such specific applications are largely to be found in the Supervision Manual (SUP) 10A; and in relation to the senior managers and certification regime, the main provisions so applied are listed in the Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls sourcebook (SYSC) at SYSC 23.3.3G. The effect of GEN 2.2.26R(1) and GEN 2.2.32R also includes a rule which applied immediately before IP completion day25 to a firm’s activity beyond the activity that was its permitted activity under Schedule 3 (or its permitted activity under Schedule 4 to the Act or beyond the activity that was permitted under paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 5 to the Act). For example, where such a firm had a Part 4A permission for that other activity before IP completion day25 (i.e. it had a top-up permission). None of GEN 2.2.26R(1), GEN 2.2.26R(2) and GEN 2.2.32R prevent changes being made to the rules that apply to such firms on and after IP completion day25. GEN 2.2.26R(2) refers to a rule which deals with a matter which immediately before IP completion day25 was reserved to the Home State of the firm. These rules include both rules that under an EU directive are always the responsibility of that state, such as rules concerning the safeguarding of client assets, and also rules the responsibility for which depends on whether the service or activity takes place at a branch or establishment in a state other than the Home State of the firm or is provided cross border from a branch or establishment in the Home State. For example, it would cover all of the rules which implement the provisions which are the responsibility of the Home State under, as the case may be, article 34 or article 35 of MIFID. GEN 2.2.26R(2)(b) and the words in (4) and (6) concerning the EEA State where the TP firm has its establishment will be applicable in a situation where an EU directive includes a country of origin provision (one which generally requires compliance with the law of the state where the establishment from which the service is provided), such as the E-Commerce Directive or the Distance Marketing Directive. In that case GEN 2.2.26R(2)(b) and the related words in (4) and (6) would apply to an FCA rule which deals with a matter reserved, under such a directive, to the law of the state where the TP firm has its establishment from which the service is provided, an example of which is the rules in COBS 5.2. The effect of GEN 2.2.26R(2) is to apply a rule to the extent that the rule implemented an EU directive, notwithstanding that before IP completion day25 the matter was reserved to the Home State or to the state where the establishment from which the service is provided is situated. A rule which the FCA imposes by virtue of a national discretion set out in a directive is to be taken as a rule which implements a directive. Where a TP firm’s home state or, where relevant, the country of origin of the firm’s establishment exercises a national discretion expressly permitted by a directive not to apply a provision, which the FCA has chosen to apply through a rule, the firm has no need to comply with or apply the rule in question. To the extent a rule goes beyond what is necessary to implement a directive, it does not apply as a result of GEN 2.2.26R(2). Therefore a more stringent rule applied by the FCA in relation to a minimum harmonisation EU directive would not be applied by GEN 2.2.26R(2). The General Rules set out in GEN 2.2.26R to 2.2.31G do not address EEA fund managers which only market funds in the UK without carrying on any regulated activity here (e.g. without managing any funds). The definition of TP firm does not include a person which was a recognised scheme under section 264 of the Act and a person which exercised its right only to market an AIF in the UK in accordance with Schedule 3 to the Act. Persons when only marketing are defined for these rules and guidance as TP UCITS qualifiers and TP AIFM qualifiers, and are covered by GEN 2.2.32R, 2.2.33R, 2.2.34R and 2.2.35R. An example of a matter falling within GEN 2.2.28R(1) or GEN 2.2.34R(1) may be a rule which on IP completion day25 (as a result of an amendment made under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018) then only refers to membership of a UK professional body. Where GEN 2.2.28R(1) or GEN 2.2.34R(1) applies, the firm may treat the rule in question as if it continued to refer to an EEA professional body. In determining the rules that apply to them by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R(1), TP firms may as a starting point find it helpful to refer to the table in SUP 13A Annex 1 (Rules that apply to incoming EEA firms) as it applied immediately before IP completion day25. However, the table will not apply in its entirety to each TP firm, for example, because a TP firm with top-up permission (see paragraph (3)) needs to continue to comply with rules that apply in relation to that activity, and specified rules referred to in the table were deleted on IP completion day and are not applied by the General Rules as set out in GEN 2.2.27R(2)), namely those in COMP and FEES 6. In determining the rules that apply to them by virtue of GEN 2.2.26R(2), TP firms may as a starting point find it helpful to refer to the table in SUP 13A Annex 2G (Matters reserved to the home state) as it applied immediately before IP completion day25. GEN 2.2.27R(3) concerns the use of the FCA’s standstill direction to disapply or modify certain obligations as a result of the operation of exit instruments. That direction does not apply to rules applied to TP firms by the general approach rules. GEN 2.2.27R(3) therefore achieves a similar result to the direction by disapplying the requirement in GEN 2.2.27R(1)(a) to comply with changes made to a rule in question which comes into force on IP completion day25 to address an issue resulting from the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union. Since GEN 2.2.27R(3) states that, where it applies, a TP firm does not have to comply with a rule as amended referred to in GEN 2.2.27R(1)(a), it is open to the TP firm to comply with such a rule while the FCA’s standstill direction is in force. GEN 2.2.33R(3) has the same effect in relation to TP UCITS qualifiers and TP AIFM qualifiers. In contrast, GEN 2.2.27R(4), where it applies, has the effect that a TP firm has to comply with a prudential rule which applies to it as the rule was immediately before IP completion day25."
High Level Standards,GEN General Provisions,GEN 2 Interpreting the Handbook,GEN 2.2 Interpreting the Handbook,Rules and guidance applying while a firm has temporary permission – tied agents,"A tied agent that is an appointed representative may not start to act as a tied agent until it is included on the Financial Services Register (see section 39(1A) of the Act). To ensure that a tied agent is included on the Financial Services Register, a TP firm should complete the Appointed representative appointment form in SUP 12 Annex 3R when appointing a tied agent to carry on MiFID business on its behalf in the United Kingdom. A TP firm that terminates its relationship with a tied agent that was required to be notified to the FCA should complete the Appointed representative termination form in SUP 12 Annex 5R to have that tied agent removed from the Financial Services Register."
High Level Standards,GEN General Provisions,GEN 2 Interpreting the Handbook,GEN 2.2 Interpreting the Handbook,TP firms that enter the financial services contracts regime under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations,"As the definitions of TP firm and temporary permission also include TP firms under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations, the rules and guidance in GEN 2.2.26R to GEN 2.2.35G also apply to firms which enter the financial services contracts regime set out in Part 6 of those Regulations after IP completion day25 having been in temporary permission under Part 3 of those Regulations, or which become TP firms under regulation 32 of those Regulations. The application of rules and guidance to TP firms under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations must be read in the light of the purpose of temporary permission under Part 6 of those Regulations, which is to enable such a TP firm to run down its regulated business in the United Kingdom. Regulation 33 or 40 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations sets out the scope of permitted activities, which is generally those regulated activities previously within the scope of the firm’s passport, necessary to perform a pre-existing contract (as defined in regulation 46 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations). Accordingly, the rules and guidance in GEN 2.2.26R to 2.2.31G, and 2.2.35R to 2.2.37G continue to apply where a TP firm leaves temporary permission under Part 3 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations and then enters temporary permission under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations, namely, where the person falls within regulation 31, 37 or 38 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations. The same is true for a TP firm which leaves temporary permission under regulation 28 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations and then enters temporary permission under regulation 39 of those Regulations. In those cases, GEN 2.2.27R has the effect that any changes referred to in that rule, which happen between IP completion day25 and when the person enters temporary permission (notwithstanding that they were previously in temporary permission) under the regulation in question, apply to the TP firm. This also applies to a TP firm which enters temporary permission for the first time under regulation 32 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations. Where a TP firm enters temporary permission under regulation 32 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations, a rule referred to in GEN 2.2.26R(1) once again applies to that person, together with any changes referred to in paragraph (3). The rules applied by GEN 2.2.26R(2) to such a TP firm apply together with any changes referred to in paragraph (3)."

Accordingly, any provision of these rules which immediately before IP completion day2 applied in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar shall, with any necessary modifications to give effect to that corresponding right or obligation, continue to apply after IP completion day2; and any provision which did not so apply shall continue not to apply, unless provision indicating the contrary intention is made. In GEN 2.3, a reference to “Gibraltar” includes, but is not limited to, rights or obligations conferred or imposed in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar-based firms, public institutions established, persons resident and body corporates incorporated in Gibraltar, and activities of firms in Gibraltar. In GEN 2.3 “Gibraltar-based firm” has the same meaning as in the Gibraltar Order."

Guidance which, immediately before IP completion day2, was guidance on or in connection with an enactment other than a rule, shall continue to apply on and after IP completion day2 in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar to the same extent as the enactment continues to apply in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar."

Accordingly, any amendment to or deletion of a rule or guidance made to address a matter arising from the UK’s withdrawal from the EU is to be disregarded to the extent it changed the application of a rule or guidance in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar. As such, any rule or guidance that applied before IP completion day2 in relation to or in connection with a Gibraltar-based firm, a person resident in Gibraltar, a body corporate incorporated in Gibraltar, or the activities of a firm in Gibraltar will so apply after IP completion day2 with any necessary modifications, taking into account any other amendments made on IP completion day2. However, the approach in GEN 2.3.1R is a general one, and as such that approach does not apply where a rule or guidance states explicitly that a different provision applies in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar or where a different position is explicitly stated in relation to a rule or guidance. In GEN 2.3.1R, the contrary intention should be construed in the light of regulations made under the EUWA. GEN 2.3.1R is not intended to apply where the application of a rule or guidance in the FCA Handbook in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar would be contrary to the intention of regulations made under the EUWA or would have a result that is incompatible or inconsistent with the legislative scheme with which the rule or guidance is connected. The rules and guidance are saved subject to any necessary modification to give effect to a right or obligation that corresponds to the right or obligation that existed before IP completion day2. So, for example, where the removal of a reference to a matter in relation to Gibraltar could make it impracticable for a Gibraltar-based firm exercising market access rights by virtue of the Gibraltar Order to continue to comply with a rule, the rule should be construed as applying, to the extent necessary, as if it continued to refer to a matter in relation to Gibraltar. An example of such a matter may be a rule which on and after IP completion day2(as a result of an amendment made under the EUWA) refers only to the membership of a UK professional body. Where this is the case, a Gibraltar-based firm may treat the rule as if it continues to refer to a Gibraltar-based professional body, if that is necessary to correspond with the obligation that had effect in relation to the Gibraltar-based firm before IP completion day2. None of GEN 2.3.1R or GEN 2.3.2R prevents changes being made to rules and guidance that apply in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar after IP completion day2."

Where GEN 2.3.1R and GEN 2.3.2R apply in relation to a Gibraltar-based firm exercising market access rights by virtue of the Gibraltar Order, in determining which rules and guidance could apply to them in the UK, such firms may, as a starting point, find it helpful to refer to the table in SUP 13A Annex 1G (Rules that applied to incoming EEA firms) as it applied immediately before IP completion day2.

High Level Standards,GEN General Provisions,GEN 2 Interpreting the Handbook,GEN 2 Annex 1 Designated investment exchanges,,"Introduction
1.
A designated investment exchange is an exchange appearing in the list of such exchanges in the Glossary.
Benefits of designation
2.
Under certain rules, firms may treat transactions effected on a designated investment exchange in the same way as transactions on RIEs (for example, see  CASS 2).
Criteria for inclusion in the list of designated investment exchanges
3.
Before adding an investment exchange to the list of designated investment exchanges in the Handbook, the FCA5 will comply with all the requirements imposed by the Act in relation to the exercise of its rule-making powers. This will include consulting on the proposed amendment to the list.
4.
In considering compatibility of the proposed addition with the statutory objectives5, the FCA5 will determine whether the investment exchange provides an appropriate degree of protection for consumers having regard in particular to:
(1)
the relevant law and practice, including the regulatory framework in which the investment exchange operates, in the country or territory in which the investment exchange's head office is situated and any other relevant country or territory; and
(2)
the rules and practices of the investment exchange.
5.
Only investment exchanges which do not carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom and are not regulated markets may be added to the list. This is because an investment exchange carrying on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom will need to apply for recognition as an RIE, or authorisation, and because a regulated market is usually treated in the same way as an RIE in the rules.
Applications to be added to the list of designated investment exchanges
6.
An application to be added to the list should be in writing and delivered to the FCA5 by:
(1)
post to:
The Financial Conduct Authority5
12 Endeavour Square4
London
E20 1JN4; or
(2)
leaving the application at that address.
7.
In support of the application, an investment exchange should provide information on the questions set out in the table below.
8.51
An application will not be considered by the FCA5 until the application fee has been paid. See 12FEES 3.22
Designated investment exchange questionnaire
1
In what way are members subject to formal supervision by the exchange or another supervisory or regulatory body? Describe how capital resources of members are monitored on an ongoing basis and how this is related to business done.
2
What powers does the exchange or any other supervisory or regulatory body have to intervene in a member's business in the event of misconduct, financial difficulties or otherwise?
3
What are the clearing arrangements of the exchange? How does the exchange ensure performance of a contract between its members? If relevant, what type of contract guarantee is available?
4
How is price information in respect of contracts effected on the exchange disseminated to investors, particularly those investors in the United Kingdom?
5
What are the exchange's arrangements for reporting and recording of transactions effected on the exchange? Please describe.
6
Does the exchange, or any other supervisory or regulatory body, require members to segregate the money and assets of the member's clients from the money and assets of the member? If so, please describe in outline how this operates. If not, are investors protected in any other way in the event of the insolvency of a member or the exchange?
7
Does the exchange have procedures for the investigation of complaints? Please describe what they are.
8
Does the exchange classify the different contracts traded on it in terms of liquidity? Is it possible to identify certain contracts which are more liquid than others and in which a ready market might be considered to exist?"

For example, it makes sure, where relevant, that the definition of “Member State” used in EU-derived legislation is treated as if it includes “the UK” and that references to “EU law” (however expressed) are read as a reference to such law so far as it is applicable to and in the UK by virtue of Part 4 of the withdrawal agreement.

paragraph 23 of Schedule 1ZA of the Act;13
regulation 92 of the Payment Services Regulations;13
regulation 59 of the Electronic Money Regulations;13
article 25(a) of the MCD Order;15
regulation 21 of the Small and Medium Sized Businesses (Credit Information) Regulations. 13

Case fees payable to the FOS Ltd are set out in FEES 5.5B.13
Fee-paying payment service providers, fee-paying electronic money issuers, CBTL firms, designated finance platforms14 and designated credit reference agencies are not required to pay the FSCS levy but are liable for FOS levies.13"
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 2 General Provisions,FEES 2.1 Introduction,Purpose,"Regulation 92 of the Payment Services Regulations and regulation 59 of the Electronic Money Regulations each provide7 that the functions of the FCA17 under the respective7 regulations are treated for the purposes of paragraph 23 of Schedule 1ZA17 to the Act as functions conferred on the FCA17 under the Act. Paragraph 23(7) 21 however, has not been included 21.7This is 21the FCA's177 obligation to ensure that the amount of penalties received or expected to be received are not to be taken into account in determining the amount of any fee payable.21"
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 2 General Provisions,FEES 2.1 Introduction,Purpose,Article 25 of the MCD Order provides that the functions under the MCD Order are to be treated for the purposes of paragraph 23 of Schedule 1ZA to the Act as functions conferred on the FCA under the Act.
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 2 General Provisions,FEES 2.1 Introduction,Purpose,"The FCA also has a fee-raising power as a result of:14
regulation 21 of the Small and Medium Sized Business (Credit Information) Regulations;15
regulation 18 of the Small and Medium Sized Business (Finance Platforms) Regulations;15
regulation 40 of the DRS Regulations; and15
paragraph 25 of the Schedule 1 to the MiFI Regulations.15
The FCA’s functions under these regulations are treated as functions conferred on the FCA under the Act for the purposes of its fee-raising power in paragraph 23 of Schedule 1ZA to the Act or as if they had similar effect for these purposes15."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 2 General Provisions,FEES 2.1 Introduction,Purpose,"The FCA’s fees payable will vary from one fee year17 to another, and will reflect the FCA’s 12funding requirement for that period and the other key components, as described in FEES 2.1.7G. Periodic fees, which will normally be payable on an annual basis, will provide the majority of the funding required to enable the FCA 12to undertake its statutory functions."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 2 General Provisions,FEES 2.1 Introduction,Purpose,"The key components of the FCA fee mechanism (excluding the FSCS 5levy, the FOS5 levy and case fees16 which are dealt with in FEES 5 and16 FEES 616)5 are:
a funding requirement derived from:
the FCA’s 12financial management and reporting framework;
the FCA’s 12budget; and
adjustments for audited variances between budgeted and actual expenditure in the previous accounting year, and reserves movements (in accordance with the FCA’s 12reserves policy);
mechanisms for applying penalties received during previous financial years for the benefit of fee payers;
fee-blocks, which are broad groupings of fee payers offering similar products and services and presenting broadly similar risks to the FCA’s 12regulatory objectives;
a costing system to allocate an appropriate part of the funding requirement to each fee-block; and
tariff bases, which, when combined with fee tariffs, allow the calculation of fees."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 2 General Provisions,FEES 2.1 Introduction,Purpose,"The amount payable by each fee payer will depend upon the category (or categories) of regulated activity or exemption, or other relevant activity applicable to that person (fee-blocks). It will, in most cases, also depend on the amount of the business that person conducts in each category (fee tariffs)."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 2 General Provisions,FEES 2.1 Introduction,Purpose,"By basing fee-blocks on categories of business, the FCA aims to minimise cross-sector subsidies. The membership of the fee-blocks is identified in the FEES provisions relating to the type of fees concerned."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 2 General Provisions,FEES 2.1 Introduction,Purpose,"PRA-authorised persons and persons seeking to become PRA-authorised persons should note that the FCA and the PRA have agreed for the FCA to act as the PRA's collection 12agent for 12PRA fees. Where applicable, both PRA and FCA fees should be paid as a single payment to the FCA, which will receive the payment in its own capacity in respect of FCA fees and in its capacity as collection 12agent for the PRA in respect of the PRA fees. References to this arrangement will be referred to in FEES where applicable."

(a)
breaches or potential breaches by that person of requirements under the Small and Medium Sized Business (Credit Information) Regulations or the Small and Medium Sized Business (Finance Platform) Regulations1.

(4)
R
The DCRFP 1is calculated as follows:
(a)
Determine the number of hours, or partial hours, taken by the FCA in performing the regulatory work described at (2)(a) and/or (b).
(b)
Use the table at FEES 3 Annex 9(11)R to determine the relevant pay grades of those employed by the FCA to perform the regulatory work described at (2)(a) and/or (b).
(c)
Next, multiply the applicable pay grade rate in the table at FEES 3 Annex 9(11)R by the number of hours or part hours obtained under (a).
(d)
Then add any fees and disbursements invoiced to the FCA by any person in respect of services performed by that person for the FCA in relation to assisting it in performing the regulatory work referred to in 2(a) and/or (b).
(e)
The resulting figure is the DCRFP1.

If the FCA issues more than one invoice, there is a single floor under (3) and not a separate one for each instalment.

	(1)		

The Special Project Fee for restructuring (the SPFR) is only payable by a TP firm or TA PI firm in one of the following categories:




(a)	
if it is in any of the A fee-blocks (as defined in Part 1 of FEES 4 Annex 1AR); or




(b)
	if it is in fee-block G.3 (as defined in FEES 4 Annex 11R).


R	
(2)	

	The SPFR becomes payable by a TP firm or TA PI firm falling into (1)(a) or (b) if it engages in, or prepares to engage in, activity which involves it undertaking or making arrangements with a view to any of the following:




(a)	
raising additional capital; or




(b)	
a significant restructuring of the TP firm or TA PI firm or the group to which it belongs, including:





(i) mergers or acquisitions;






(ii) reorganising the TP firm’s or TA PI firm’s  group structure;






(iv) a significant change to the TP firm’s or TA PI firm’s business model; and






(v) a significant internal change programme.



R	
(3)	

	No SPFR is payable under (2) if the transaction only involves the TP firm or TA PI firm seeking to raise capital within the group to which it belongs.


R
	(4)	

	Where the transaction in (2) involves raising capital outside the TP firm or TA PI firm to which the TP firm or TA PI firm belongs, any SPFR in relation to that transaction is only payable by the largest TP firm or TA PI firm in that group. The largest firm is the one that pays the highest periodic fee in the fee year in which the bill is raised. For the purpose of the calculation in (9), all time spent and fees and disbursements incurred in relation to the group are added together.


R
	(5)		

The definition of group is limited for the purposes of calculating the SPFR to parent undertakings and their subsidiary undertakings.


R	
(6)		

The FCA will levy its own SPFR separate to any levy issued by the PRA, and this may be in relation to the same event or circumstance.


R	
(7)		

No SPFR is payable to the FCA:




(a)
	if the amount calculated in accordance with (8) in relation to the regulatory work conducted by the FCA totals less than £25,000 in the case of a TP firm in fee-blocks A.1 or A.3 or A.4, or £50,000 in the case of a TP firm in any of the other A fee-blocks; or




(b)	
for time spent giving guidance to the TP firm or TA PI firm in relation to the same matter if the FCA has charged that TP firm or TA PI firm for that guidance.


R
	(8)		

The SPFR for the FCA is calculated as follows:




(a)	
Determine the number of hours, or part of an hour, taken by the FCA in relation to regulatory work conducted as a consequence of the activities referred to in (2).




(b)
	Next, multiply the applicable rate in the table at (11) by the number of hours or part hours obtained under (a).





(c)	
Then add any fees and disbursements invoiced to the FCA by any person in respect of services performed by that person for the FCA in relation to assisting the FCA in performing the regulatory work referred to in (a).





(d)	
The resulting figure is the fee.

General definition for all relevant fee-blocks (other than where the firm is an operator of a UK Recognised Investment Exchange, a Multilateral Trading Facility, an Organised Trading Facility a Regulated Benchmark Administrator or a Claims Management Company)""Annual income"" for a particular fee block (the “relevant fee block”) is the gross inflow of economic benefits (i.e. cash, receivables and other assets) recognised in the firm's accounts during the reporting year in respect of, or in relation to, the provision in the UK of the regulated activities specified in FEES 4 Annex 1A R Part 1 as belonging to the relevant fee block .The figure should be reported for the relevant fee block without netting off the operating costs or business expenses, but including:(a) all brokerages, commissions, fees, and other related income (for example, administration charges, overriders, profit shares etc) due to the firm in respect of, or in relation to, the provision in the UK of the regulated activities specified in FEES 4 Annex 1A R Part 1 as belonging to the relevant fee block and which the firm has not rebated to clients or passed on to other authorised firms (for example, where there is a commission chain).

This is the commission equivalent or an estimate of the amount the firm would otherwise have received for any regulated activity under (a) above, but for which it has made a business decision to waive or discount its charges.Definition for UK Recognised Investment Exchanges
“Annual income” for a UK recognised investment exchange is the gross inflow of economic benefits (i.e. cash, receivables and other assets) recognised in the firm’s accounts during the reporting year in respect of, or in relation to activities that comprise a necessary part of an exchange’s business as an investment exchange.
This should include all revenues the firm derives from operating multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities.For the purposes of calculating annual income of the UK recognised investment exchange include amounts received in relation to the operation of its markets; access to those markets; the submission, management and execution of orders; quotes or transactions on those markets; the supply of pre-and post- trade transparency information about those markets; fees for admission to trading or listing; membership of connectivity charges; fees for order execution or management; trade reporting; market data and any other relevant revenue streams.Definition for firms operating Multilateral Trading Facilities and Organised Trading FacilitiesThis refers to firms operating a multilateral trading facility or organised trading facility.“Annual income” for an operator of a multilateral trading facility or organised trading facility is the gross inflow of economic benefits (i.e. cash, receivables and other assets) recognised in the firm’s accounts during the reporting year in respect of, or in relation to activities that comprise a necessary part of the firm’s business as an operator of a multilateral trading facility or organised trading facility.For the purposes of calculating annual income of the operator of a multilateral trading facility or organised trading facility include amounts received in relation to the operation of its markets; access to those markets; the submission, management and execution of orders; quotes or transactions on those markets; the supply of pre-and post-trade transparency information about those markets; fees for admission to trading or listing; membership of connectivity charges; fees for order execution or management; trade reporting; market data and any other relevant revenue streams.
Where the firm is a Regulated Benchmark Administrator 
“Annual income” for a regulated benchmark administrator is the gross inflow of economic benefits (i.e. cash, receivables and other assets) recognised in the firm’s accounts during the reporting year in respect of, or in relation to activities in the UK that comprise a necessary part of its business as a regulated benchmark administrator. 
Where the sales and marketing of a benchmark are undertaken by a separate legal entity, the regulated benchmark administrator is responsible for identifying the relevant income and reporting it to us as its own income. To avoid double counting, the regulated benchmark administrator should report only the income from sales and exclude any amount paid to it from that income to pay for its expenses as a regulated benchmark administrator. Where the firm’s regulated activities are carried on by an appointed representative of the firmThe firm's annual income must include income received by an appointed representative carrying a regulated activity in a relevant fee block on behalf of the firm. The appointed representative's annual income must be calculated in the same way as the firm's.  However, to avoid double counting, the appointed representative's annual income must not include any income also recognised in the firm’s accounts, including income recognised as a result of a commission sharing arrangement with the appointed representative. Where the relevant fee-block is fee-block A.18For the purposes of calculating annual income for fee-block A.18, also include the following:(d) for any home finance mediation activity carried out by the firm for which it receives payment from the lender or provider on a basis other than that in (a), the value of all new mortgage advances and amounts provided under other home finance transactions resulting from that activity multiplied by 0.004;PLUS:(e) if the firm is a home finance provider, the value of all new mortgage advances and amounts provided under other home finance transactions which are regulated mortgage contracts, home purchase plans, home reversion plans or regulated sale and rent back mediation activity, multiplied by 0.004m, excluding mortgage advances and home finance transactions which result from home finance mediation activity carried on by another firm, where payment has been made by the home finance provider to that other firm under (a);PLUS: (f) for firms whose permission includes administering regulated mortgage contracts, but not entering into a regulated mortgage contract and firms whose permission includes administering a home finance transaction but not entering into a home finance transaction, and in either case whose permission does not include advising on a home finance transaction, the relevant amounts are multiplied by 0.15.  Where the relevant fee-block is fee-block A.19For the purposes of calculating annual income for fee-block A.19, also include the following:(g) in relation to any activities in (a), for any insurance distribution activity carried out by the firm for which it receives payment from the insurer on a basis other than that in (a), the amount of premiums receivable on its contracts of insurance multiplied by 0.07;PLUS: (h) if the firm is an insurer in relation to the activities in (a), the amount of premiums receivable on its contracts of insurance multiplied by 0.07,excluding those contracts of insurance which:- result from insurance distribution activity by another firm, where payment has been made by the insurer to the firm under (a); or- are not general insurance contracts or pure protection contracts.AND(i) for the purposes of calculating annual income for fee-block A.19:-  the provision in the UK of the regulated activities specified in FEES 4 Annex 1A Part 1 as belonging to the relevant fee block includes the provision of activities that would have been insurance distribution activity in relation to general insurance contracts or pure protection contracts if they had been carried on after 13 January 2005 or, in relation to connected travel insurance contracts, from 1 January 2009; - a reference to a ""firm "" includes a reference to any person, including a connected travel insurance intermediary, who carried on activities which would be insurance distribution activity (in respect of general insurance contracts or pure protection contracts) if they had been carried on after 13 January 2005 or, in relation to connected travel insurance contracts, from 1 January 2009.Guidance on the interpretation of this definition is presented in FEES 4 Annex 13  G.Where the firm is a Claims Management Company (fee-block claims management company)

Part 1 – Method for calculating the fee for fee-paying payment service providers


The periodic fee is calculated by identifying the relevant activity group under Part 2 and multiplying the tariff base identified in Part 3 of FEES 4 Annex 16R by the appropriate rates in the table at Part 4. 


Part 2 – Activity groups


Activity group
Fee payer falls into this group if:


J.1
it is a credit rating agency or certified credit rating agency; or


J.2
it is a trade repository or recognised trade repository; or


J.3
it is a securitisation repository. 



Part 3
This table indicates the tariff base for each fee-block. The tariff base is the means by which the FCA measures the amount of business conducted by a firm.



J.1 Credit rating agencies
APPLICABLE TURNOVER
This is revenue generated from the credit rating agency’s   activities and ancillary services.



J.2 Trade repositories
APPLICABLE TURNOVER
This is the sum of revenues generated from:
(a) the core functions of centrally collecting and maintaining records of derivatives and securities financing transactions; and
(b) ancillary services that are directly related to centrally collecting and maintaining records of derivatives
and securities financing transactions.Ancillary services include:
(i) direct provision by the trade repository;
(ii) indirect provision by a company within the trade repository’s group; and
(iii) where an entity with which the trade repository has concluded an agreement in the context of the trading or post-trading chain or business line to cooperate in the provision of services provides the ancillary services.
Where a trade repository’s accounts do not distinguish revenue from ancillary services under different activities, it should determine the share each activity represents of the turnover from providing core services and apply that to the composite ancillary revenue figure.



J.3 Securitisation repositories
APPLICABLE TURNOVER
This is the sum of revenues generated from:
(a) the core functions of centrally collecting and maintaining records of securitisations; and
(b) ancillary services that are directly related to centrally collecting and maintaining records of securitisations.
Ancillary services include:
(i) direct provision by the securitisation repository; 
(ii) indirect provision by a company within the securitisation repository’s group;
(iii) where an entity with which the securitisation repository has concluded an agreement in the context of the trading or post-trading chain or business line to cooperate in the provision of services provides the ancillary services.

High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 5 Financial Ombudsman Service Funding,FEES 5.8 Joining the Financial Ombudsman Service,,"This rule deals with the calculation of:
a firm's general levy in the 12 months ending on the 31 March in which it obtains permission, or was authorised under the Payment Services Regulations or the Electronic Money Regulations 4or had its permission and/or payment services activities extended (relevant permissions)3 and the following 12 months ending on the 31 March;3 and
the tariff base for the industry blocks that relate to each of the relevant permissions3.
Unless this rule says otherwise, the tariff base is calculated using the projected valuation for its first year of the business to which the tariff relates.
The rest of this rule only applies to a firm that becomes authorised, or extends its permission and/or payment services activities3, on or after 1 April 2009.
If the tariff base is calculated using data from a period that begins on or after the date that the firm obtains the relevant permission to which that tariff base relates3, the firm must use that data.
If a firm satisfies the following conditions it must calculate its tariff base under (c) for the FCA financial year following the FCA financial year it obtained a relevant permission3:
the firm receives a relevant permission3 between 1 April and 31 December inclusive; and
the firm's tariff base for that relevant permission is3, but for this rule, calculated by reference to the firm's financial year ended in the calendar year ending on the 331 December before the start of the FCA financial year 3or the twelve months ending 31 December before the start of 3the FCA financial year.
If a firm satisfies the conditions in (b) it must calculate its tariff base as follows:
it must use actual data in relation to the business to which the tariff relates rather than projected valuations;
the tariff is calculated by reference to the period beginning on the date it acquired the relevant permission relating to the tariff3 and ending on the 31 December before the start of the FCA financial year; and
the figures are annualised by increasing them by the same proportion as the period of 12 months bears to the period starting from when the firm received any relevant permissions3 to 31 December.
Where a firm is required to use the method in (c) it must notify the FCA of its intention to do so by the date specified in FEES 5.4 (Information requirement).
Where a firm is required to use actual data under this rule FEES 4 Annex 1R Part 3 is modified in relation to the calculation of that firms valuation date in its second financial year."

The example is based on a firm that acquires permission on 1 November 20146and has a financial year ending 31 March. Where valuation dates fall before the firm receives permission it should use projected valuations in calculating its levies.

B = twice the number of new chargeable cases (PPI) that were referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service in respect of all firms (whether or not they are part of a charging group) from 1 July to 31 December (both dates inclusive) in the immediately preceding financial year.
open chargeable cases (PPI) for group respondents -
C = the number of chargeable cases (PPI) referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service in respect of group respondents before 1 January in the immediately preceding financial year which had not been closed before 1 January in the immediately preceding financial year.
open chargeable cases (PPI) for all firms -
D = the number of chargeable cases (PPI) referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service in respect of all firms (whether or not they are part of a charging group) before 1 January in the immediately preceding financial year which had not been closed before 1 January in the immediately preceding financial year.
new chargeable cases (general) for group respondents -

open chargeable cases (general) for all firms -
H = the number of chargeable cases (general) referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service in respect of all firms (whether or not they are part of a charging group) before 1 January in the immediately preceding financial year which had not been closed before 1 January in the immediately preceding financial year.
(2) ‘Proportion X’ for each charging group is a percentage calculated as follows -
A / B x 100
(3) ‘Proportion Y’ for each charging group is a percentage calculated as follows -
{A + C} / {B + D} x 100
(4) ‘Proportion Z’ for each charging group is a percentage calculated as follows -
{E + G} / {F + H} x 100
2
The special case fee is intended to broadly reflect the budgeted workload capacity of the Financial Ombudsman Service and comprises elements in respect of:
(1) new chargeable cases (PPI);
(2) closed chargeable cases (PPI); and
(3) closed chargeable cases (general);
with a free-case allowance of:
(4) 5013 new chargeable cases (PPI); and
(5)   5013 closed chargeable cases (general).
3
The special case fee for each charging group is a total amount calculated as follows:
(1) in respect of new chargeable cases (PPI) -
{£0 x [100,00013] x the ‘proportion X’} – {£0 x 5013}
(2) in respect of closed chargeable cases (PPI) -
£65013 x [140,00013] x the ‘proportion Y’
(3) in10 respect of closed chargeable cases (general)-
{£65013 x [165,00013] x the ‘proportion Z’} – {£650 x 5013}
4
The FOS Ltd will invoice each charging group for the special case fee (calculated as above) in four equal instalments, payable in advance on the following dates during the financial year:
(1) 1 April (or, if later, when FOS Ltd has sent the invoice);

(3) 1 October; and
(4)9 1 January.
5
Year-end adjustment:
(1) If the actual number of new chargeable cases (PPI) referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service in respect of group respondents during the financial year is more than 10,000 and is more than [115%] of {[100,00013] x the 'proportion X'}:8
(a) the FOS Ltd will invoice the relevant charging group; and

(2) ‘Proportion X’ for each charging group is a percentage calculated as follows -A / B x 100


(3) ‘Proportion Y’ for each charging group is a percentage calculated as follows -{A + C} / {B + D} x 100


(4) ‘Proportion Z’ for each charging group is a percentage calculated as follows -{E + G} / {F + H} x 100


2
The special case fee is intended to broadly reflect the budgeted workload capacity of the Financial Ombudsman Service and comprises elements in respect of:


(1) new chargeable cases (PPI);


(2) closed chargeable cases (PPI); and


(3) closed chargeable cases (general);


with a free-case allowance of: 


(4) 50 new chargeable cases (PPI); and

High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,Purpose,The purpose of this chapter is to set out the requirements on participant firms to pay levies imposed by the FSCS to provide funding for its functions under COMP. The PRA Rulebook deals with funding for the FSCS’s functions for depositor protection and policyholder protection.
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,General structure,"Section 213(3)(b) of the Act requires the appropriate regulator to make rules to enable the FSCS to impose levies on authorised persons, and on recognised investment exchanges that are operating a multilateral trading facility or operating an organised trading facility, in order to meet its expenses. These expenses include in particular expenses incurred, or expected to be incurred, in paying compensation, borrowing or insuring risks."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,General structure,"Section 224F of the Act enables the appropriate regulator to make rules to enable the FSCS to impose levies on authorised persons (or any class of authorised persons) in order to meet its management expenses incurred if, under Part 15A of the Act, it is required by HM Treasury to act in relation to relevant schemes. But those rules must provide that the FSCS can impose a levy only if the FSCS has tried its best to obtain reimbursement of those expenses from the manager of the relevant scheme."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,General structure,"The FSCS may impose three types of levy: a management expenses levy (consisting of a base costs levy and a specific costs levy)9, a compensation costs levy and a MERS levy.6 The FSCS has discretion as to the amount and 9timing of the levies imposed."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,General structure,"In calculating a compensation costs levy, the FSCS may include up to the greater of one third of the compensation costs expected in the 36-month period following the12 1 April of the financial year of the compensation scheme in relation to which the levy is imposed12, or the compensation costs expected in the 12 months following that date."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,General structure,The total amount of all management expenses levies attributable to a12 financial year and levied by the FSCS under this chapter or under the PRA Rulebook12 will be restricted to the amount set out on an annual basis in FEES 6 Annex 1 R.
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,General structure,"In order to allocate a share of the amount of specific costs and compensation costs to be funded by an individual participant firm, the funding arrangements are split into six14 classes:12 the General Insurance Distribution Claims class; the Investment Intermediation Claims class; the Investment Provision Claims class; the Home Finance Intermediation Claims class; the Debt Management Claims class; and the deposit acceptors’ contribution class.14 The permissions held by a participant firm determine into which class, or classes, it falls."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,General structure,"The provisions on the allocation of levies to classes912 2 meet9 a requirement of section 213(5) of the Act that the FCA12, in making rules to enable the FSCS to impose levies, must take account of the desirability of ensuring that the amount of the levies imposed on a particular class of authorised person reflects, so far as practicable, the amount of claims made, or likely to be made, in respect of that class of person."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,The management expenses levy,"Section 223 of the Act (Management expenses) prevents the FSCS from recovering, through a levy, any management expenses attributable to a particular period in excess of the limit set in COMP as applicable to that period. 'Management expenses' are defined in section 223(3) to mean expenses incurred or expected to be incurred by the FSCS in connection with its functions under the Act, except:
expenses incurred in paying compensation;
expenses incurred as a result of the FSCS making the arrangements to secure continuity of insurance12 to make payments to or in respect of policyholders or to safeguard policyholders, under PRA rules made under sections 216(3) or (4), 217(1) or 217(6) of the Act12;5
expenses incurred under section 214B or section 214D of the Act as a result of the FSCS being required by HM Treasury to make payments in connection with the exercise of the stabilisation power under Part 1 of the Banking Act 2009; and65
expenses incurred under Part XVA of the Act as a result of the FSCS being required by HM Treasury to act in relation to a relevant scheme.6"
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,The management expenses levy,"A management expenses levy may consist of two elements. The first is a base costs levy, for 50% of12 the base costs of running the compensation scheme in a financial year12, that is, costs which are not dependent upon the level of activity of the compensation scheme and which therefore are not attributable to any specific class.9 The PRA allocates the other 50% of the base costs under its rules.12 Included in base costs12 are items such as the salary of the members of the board of the FSCS, the costs of the premises which the FSCS occupies, and its audit fees. It would also likely include the cost of any insurance cover secured by FSCS against the risk of it paying claims out in circumstances where the levy limit of the particular class to which the claim would otherwise be attributable has exceeded its levy limit for the year, as the insurance cover is likely to benefit all classes which may have costs allocated to them if the levy limit of another class is breached.2 The amount that each participant firm pays towards a base costs levy is calculated by reference to the regulatory costs paid by the firm. All participant firms are liable to contribute towards a base costs levy."
High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6.1 Application,The management expenses levy,"The second element of a management expenses levy is a specific costs levy for the ""specific costs"" of running the compensation scheme in a financial year12. These costs are attributable to a class, and include the salary costs of certain staff of the FSCS and claims handling and legal and other professional fees. It also may include the cost of any insurance cover that FSCS secures against the risk of FSCS paying out claims above a given level in any particular class (but below the levy limit for that class for the year).12 When the FSCS imposes a specific costs levy, the levy is allocated to the class which gives rise to12 those costs up to the relevant levy limits. Specific costs attributable to certain classes, which exceed the class levy limits, may be allocated to the retail pool. The FSCS may include in a specific costs levy the specific costs that the FSCS expects to incur (including in respect of defaults not yet declared at the date of the levy) during the financial year12 of the compensation scheme to which the levy relates. The amount that each participant firm pays towards the specific costs levy imposed on a class14 is calculated by reference to the amount of business conducted by the firm in that class, or categories within that class14. Each class or category14 has a 14""tariff base"" for this purpose, set out in FEES 6 Annex 3AR12. Participant firms may be exempt from contributing to the specific costs levy."

Levies allocated to the retail pool are then allocated amongst the other such classes, together with the deposit acceptors’ contribution class.14 The deposit acceptors’ contribution class14 may contribute to compensation costs levies or specific costs levies funded by the retail pool, but may not itself14 receive any such funding. 14"

The FSCS allocates a compensation costs levy and specific costs levy totalling £205 million to class 1 (General Insurance Distribution Claims) under FEES 6.5.2-AR (see FEES 6.4.6AR). For the purposes of this example, this is the first levy imposed by the FSCS in that financial year. As a result of FEES 6.5.2-AR(1A), £155 million is allocated to category 1.1 and £50 million to category 1.2.
The FSCS next imposes a levy under the PRA’s rules on the funding class (general insurers) that corresponds to category 1.2. That levy is equal to the levy limit for that funding class (general insurers) in the PRA Rulebook.
As a result of FEES 6.5.2-AAR(3) and (4), the FSCS must raise £50 million by imposing a levy on category 1.1 and credit those funds by way of repayment to category 1.2.
The FSCS then allocates a further compensation costs levy and specific costs levy totalling £50 million to class 1 under FEES 6.5.2-AR. As a result of FEES 6.5.2-AAR(2), the FSCS must allocate the whole amount of that further levy to category 1.1.
Subsequently but in the same financial year, the FSCS incurs further compensation costs and specific costs attributable to class 1 and totalling £75 million. However, if £75 million were allocated to class 1, it would cause category 1.1 to exceed its levy limit of £310 million when combined with the £255 million that category 1.1 has already paid in that financial year. Accordingly, the FSCS imposes a further compensation costs levy and specific costs levy totalling £75 million and allocates it as follows:
£55 million to category 1.1, bringing the total levies paid by that category in the financial year to its levy limit;
£0 to category 1.2; and
£20 million to the retail pool in accordance with FEES 6.5.2-AR(2)."

That levy of £100,000 is allocated to the categories within that class under FEES 6.5.2-AR(1A), with the result that £75,610 is allocated to category 1.1 and £24,390 is allocated to category 1.2.
The reports under FEES 6.5.13R and under the PRA’s compensation rules show that there are 10 participant firms in category 1.1, each doing the same amount of business in that category; and five participant firms each doing the same amount of business in category 1.2. Two of the participant firms are in both categories.
In this example, as a result of FEES 6.5.6AR, each participant firm in category 1.1 pays a levy of £7,561 and each participant firm in category 1.2 pays a levy of £4,878.

it became a participant firm or receives its extension of permission, as the case may be, between 1 April and 31 December inclusive; and
its tariff base, but for this rule, is calculated by reference to the financial year ended in the calendar year ending 31 December or the twelve months ending 31 December before the financial year of the compensation scheme.
If a participant firm satisfies the conditions in (b) it must calculate its tariff base as follows:
it must use actual data in relation to the business to which the tariff relates rather than projected valuations;
the tariff is calculated by reference to the period beginning on the date it became a participant firm or had its permission extended, and ending on the 31 December before the start of the financial year of the compensation scheme; and
the figures are annualised by increasing them by the same proportion as the period of 12 months bears to the period starting from when the participant firm became a participant firm, or had its permission extended, to the 31 December, as the case may be.

High Level Standards,FEES Fees Manual,FEES 6 Financial Services Compensation Scheme Funding,FEES 6 Annex 4 Guidance on the calculation of tariff bases,,"This table belongs to FEES 6.5.8 G
Calculation of annual eligible income2 for firms in category 2.3 and class 35 who carry out discretionary fund management and are in FCA fee block A72
2-1.14
G
The tariff base for category 2.3 and class 3 5 is calculated by taking gross income falling into category 2.3 and class 35 and then deducting commission, fees and similar amounts rebated to customers or passed on to other firms (for example, where there is a commission chain).  Items such as general business expenses (for example employees' salaries and overheads) should not be deducted.  The calculation may4 be further adjusted so as to include only4 income that is4 attributable to business in respect of which the FSCS may pay compensation4, unless the firm chooses to include all its annual4 income.2
1.14
G
Gross income for the activity of managing investments is the sum of the following:
(1)
the amount of the annual charge on all assets in portfolios which the firm manages on a discretionary basis received or receivable in the latest accounting period (this is calculated as a percentage of funds invested, typically 1% p.a.); plus
(2)
the front-end or exit charge levied on sales or redemptions of assets in portfolios which the firm manages on a discretionary basis (typically 4-5% of sales/redemptions) in that same accounting period; plus
(3)
the amount of performance management fees from the management of assets in portfolios which the firm manages on a discretionary basis received or receivable in that same accounting period; plus
(4)
any other income directly attributable to the management of assets in portfolios which the firm manages on a discretionary basis in that same accounting period, including commission and interest received.
1.24
G
Annual eligible income2 should exclude
income received or receivable from assets managed on a non-discretionary basis, being assets that the firm has a contractual duty to keep under continuous review but in respect of which prior specific consent of the client must be obtained for proposed transactions, as this activity is covered in category 2.15 (the life distribution and5 investment intermediation category5).22
1.34
G
A firm should make appropriate arrangements to ensure that income is not double counted in relation to the activities it undertakes (for example, where it operates and manages a personal pension scheme or collective investment scheme).
Calculation of annual eligible income for firms in category 2.3 and class 35 and who carry out activities within FCA4 fee block A92
2.14
G
The calculation of income in respect of activities falling into category 2.3 or class 3,5 and FCA fee block A9 should be based on the tariff base provisions for that fee block (in  Part 3 of FEES 4 Annex 1A R).6 It may4 be adjusted so as to include only4 income that is attributable to business in respect of which the FSCS may pay compensation4, unless the firm chooses to include all its annual4 income.2
22.24
G
Although the calculation should be based on the one for fee block A9, the calculation is not the same. FCA fee block A9 is based on gross income.  Category 2.3 and class 3 are5 is based on net income retained.
2Calculation of annual eligible income for a firm in categories 1.1 or 2.15
23.14
G
The amount of annual eligible income should include the amount of any trail or renewable commission due to the firm.  Trail commission is received as a small percentage of the value of a policy on an ongoing basis.  Renewable commission is received from a very small percentage of the value of a policy from ongoing premiums often received once the initial commission period is over.
2Difficulties in calculating annual eligible income
24.14
G
The purpose of Note 2 in the section of notes at the end of FEES 6 Annex 3AR4 (Financial Services Compensation Scheme - classes) is to deal with the practical difficulties of allocating income correctly between different classes3 and in deciding whether income falls outside FEES 6 Annex 3AR4 altogether.  Note 2 requires a firm to carry out the necessary apportionment on a reasonable and consistent basis.
24.24
G
The following provides some guidance as to how firms may approach the allocation of annual eligible income.
24.34
G
Where a firm cannot separate its income on the basis of activities, such as a fund manager which acts on a discretionary and non-discretionary basis for the same client and who only sends out a single invoice, the firm may apportion the income in another way.  For instance, a firm may calculate that the business it undertook for a client was split 90% on a discretionary basis and 10% on a non-discretionary basis calculated by reference to funds under management.  The firm may split the income accordingly.
24.44
G
A firm may allocate trail or renewable commission on the basis of the type of firm it receives it from.  For instance, if it comes from a life provider the firm may consider it as life and pensions mediation income.  If it comes from a fund manager the firm may treat it as investment mediation income.
24.54
G
If a firm receives annual eligible income from a platform based business it may report annual eligible income in line with the proportionate split of business that the firm otherwise undertakes.  For instance, if a firm receives 70% of its other commission from life and pensions mediation business and 30% from investment mediation business, then it may divide what it receives in relation to the platform business on the same basis.
44.5A
G
Firms should have regard to the ability of the FSCS to pay compensation to members of pension schemes and to participants in collective investment schemes (see COMP 12A (Special cases)) when calculating their annual eligible income.
24.64
G
Unless a firm chooses to include all relevant annual income, annual eligible income excludes business that is not compensatable under the compensation scheme.  This can create difficulties because, for example, a person may move between being and not being an eligible claimant over time.  The purpose of Note 3 in the section of notes at the end of FEES 6 Annex 3AR4 is to deal with that difficulty by fixing a date for deciding this.
